    description: `“Forrest Gump” narrates the life story of its titular character, Forrest, as he recounts his journey while sitting on a bench waiting for a bus. Born in the 1940s in Greenbow, Alabama, Forrest faces numerous challenges due to his low IQ and leg braces, but he is buoyed by his mother’s unwavering love and encouragement.
        Through sheer determination, Forrest discovers his extraordinary talent for running, which eventually earns him a scholarship to the University of Alabama, where he witnesses the early days of the civil rights movement. Despite his intellectual limitations, Forrest unknowingly plays a pivotal role in the integration of the university.
        Forrest’s life takes unexpected turns as he serves in the Vietnam War and befriends Bubba (Mykelti Williamson), a fellow soldier with dreams of starting a shrimping business. Following the war, Forrest fulfills Bubba’s dream and builds a successful shrimping empire with Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise), a former commanding officer who lost his legs in the war.
        Forrest’s love for Jenny (Robin Wright), his childhood friend and unrequited love, remains a constant thread throughout his life. Jenny’s struggles with her past and search for meaning intertwine with Forrest’s journey, as he remains steadfast in his love and devotion to her. `,

    description: `Everything you've ever heard is true...
        THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.
        
        Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.
        
        Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.
        
        Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.
